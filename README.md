# Analysis of Major League Baseball Salaries
Anybody who looks at the current salaries of the highest paid baseball players these days is immediately in awe. Justin Verlander just recently tied the record for average annual value salary, making over 43 million dollars per year. Several players are making over 30 million, and over 50 MLB players are making at least 20 million dollars per year. Our work is an exploration into these salaries, seeing how much players really deserve such salaries. We will compare players to one another, taking note of how well they perform compared to other players, and how much money they make compared to other players. To learn more about the highest paid baseball players today, please look at https://www.nbcsports.com/washington/nationals/here-are-highest-paid-mlb-players-2022-season.

In this project, we will look both at batters and pitchers, comparing batters' salaries to other batters' salaries, and doing the same for pitchers. Our null hypothesis is that a player's performances has no affect on his salary. We hope to reject this null hypothesis, showing that there is indeed a correlation between these high-paid baseball players and their actual performace throughout the season.

For a quick look, some of our data comparisons are shown below.
